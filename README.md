# CoffeeMachine
This is a simple coffee machine made with Python. It lets the user do four things: buy coffee (three types - esspresso, latte, cappuccino), refill the supplies, take out all the money, and show the current amount of supplies and money. 

To use, simply run **CoffeeMachine.py**. It will ask the user to enter one of four options: buy, fill, take, and remaining. If you would like to quit the program, simply type exit.
